## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this, echo is false

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

## Try a few things myself

### Repet previos code with echo true

```{r}
#| echo: true
2*2
```
(Code chunk should have been visible)

### Next up... make a histogram:

```{r}
hist(iris$Petal.Length)
```

SHould have displayed a histogram. Is code chunk visible or not? (default)

### Now histogram with code chunk

```{r}
#| echo: true

hist(iris$Petal.Length)
```

SHould have shown histogram with code chunk, explicitly coded

### Now histogram without code chunk

```{r}
#| echo: false
hist(iris$Petal.Length)
```

SHould have shown hisstogram without code chunk.
